# Light Language ðŸ–¤ðŸ’™ðŸ’›

Light it's a language that bring peace for people.

Tools and technologies are made to bring people happiness, not fear and despair.

This is not a toy project. In the next months I (or we) will turn this project alive!

## Principles

- Can't be used to harm people
- Speed
- Manutelability
- Compile for multiple platforms
- Easy to interop with others languages
- Full featured

## Roadmap

- [x] Define roadmap (just draft for now)
- [-] WIP Define features (based mainly on ELM...) - ~3-6 months
- [ ] Define language to write the first compiler version - will be V or Zig
- [ ] Simple translator from Light to V - ~1 year
- [ ] Apply F# features - ~2 years
