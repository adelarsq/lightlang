# Light Language ðŸ’¡

ðŸ–¤ðŸ’™ðŸ’›

Light it's a language that bring peace for people.

Tools and technologies are made to bring people happiness, not fear and despair.

This is not a toy project. In the next months I (or we) will turn this project alive!

## Principles

- Can't be used to harm people. See [License](LICENSE)
- Performance and energy efficiency [1](https://greenlab.di.uminho.pt/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/paperSLE.pdf)
- Manutenability
- Strongly typed
- Compile for multiple platforms
- Easy to interop with others languages
- Full featured
